# Coral_Colony
image recognition software to identify and display the areas of change on the coral colony.	

It is required to determine the health of the coral colony by comparing the current
image to an image taken one year ago (given in the drive link below) and show any
changes.

compare images to assess whether the coral has grown, is
damaged/has died, is bleached, or has recovered from bleaching :
● Growth is defined as the coral colony having new pink branches not seen in the
previous image.

● Damage or death is defined as the coral colony missing branches that were seen in
the previous image.

● Coral bleaching is defined as pink colored branches from the previous photo having
turned white.

● Recovery from bleaching is defined as white branches from the previous photo now
being colored pink.	

Requirements:	
The program should outline areas where the coral has changed. The following
parameters must be used :	
● Areas of growth should be marked with a green rectangle around the affected area.

● Areas of damage or death should be marked with a yellow rectangle around the
affected area.

● Areas of bleaching should be marked with a red rectangle around the affected area.

● Areas that have recovered from bleaching should be marked with a blue rectangle
around the affected area.
